# DoorDash Clone
Clone of front page from DoorDash.

## Project Aims
To practice HTML & CSS, specifically positioning elements and divs for use on desktops. Where possible, not attempt will be made to copy the HMTL/CSS but the clone will be built from visual comparison only.

## Challenges

No experience of SVG images so some elements couldn't be replicated, namely the iphone and Google play links

Positioning within divs took a while and a lot of trial and error and not sure it was done in the most efficient mannor.

Changing the unordered list from vertical to horizontal proved tricky, one of the gaps in knowledge I was aware of prior to starting this challenge.
